## üí° Assumptions Made During Development

1. **Task Persistence**:
   - Tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage` to maintain them even after refreshing the page.

2. **Task Prioritization**:
   - Priority levels are predefined (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and can be assigned to tasks during creation.

3. **Filters**:
   - "Completed" and "Incomplete" filters display tasks based on their `completed` status.
  
4. **Default Behavior**:
   - By default, tasks are displayed in the order they were added (chronological).

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic input validation ensures tasks cannot be added without a title.
